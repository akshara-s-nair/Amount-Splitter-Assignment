# amount-splitter

### Question
Often during many occasions, you would have gone outing with your friends. At 
many places all of you would have spent for various activities. On coming back, it 
is often tedious to calculate the amount spent by each one of you and to compute 
how much money each one of you should give others or get from others.  
Write a program to compute the split-expenses made by you and your friends.  
Initialize your program with six names and five activities (say taxi, breakfast, 
lunch, dinner and movie). Your program should prompt for the expenses for each 
activity. The amount spent on each activity and by whom will form the input for 
the prompt. (Note: more than one of you might have spent for the same activity. 
For example watching movies might have involved expenses related to tickets and 
refreshments from two different friends). 
Once the split-expenses have been input along with the names, your program 
should compute the amount, each of the six names (you initialized in the 
beginning of your program) should either pay or get.
